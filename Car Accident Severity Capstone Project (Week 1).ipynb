The most unfortunate thing is that we don't learn from our mistakes on road. Most of the road users are quite well aware of the general rules and safety measures while using roads but it is only the laxity on part of road users, which cause accidents and crashes. Main cause of accidents and crashes are due to human errors.\nSolutions that can help decrease accidents are categorized into three systems: active (often preventative measures, such as driver support or warning systems), passive (such as the roll cage in the vehicle) and behavioral (these include education, together with behaviors such as wearing a seatbelt).\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "2.\tA description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.
